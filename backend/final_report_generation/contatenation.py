    Merge three JSON "streams" (files) into a single JSON file by matching records on the "timestamp" key.

    Parameters
    ----------
    audio : str
        Path to a JSON file containing a list (array) of objects with a "timestamp" field and audio-related keys
        (e.g., "confidence", "emotion", "tone").
    video : str
        Path to a JSON file containing a list of objects with a "timestamp" field and video/body-language keys
        (e.g., "smile_intensity", "eye_contact_ratio").
    text : str
        Path to a JSON file containing a list of objects with a "timestamp" field and text/transcript keys
        (e.g., "transcription").
    
    Returns
    ----------
    None
        The merged JSON is written to "merged.json". The function does not return the merged data.
