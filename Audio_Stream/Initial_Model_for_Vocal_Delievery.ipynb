            "[01:04.000 --> 01:17.000]  In my living group, we had a problem that the rent was getting too expensive because we didn't have quite enough people living there.\n",

            "[01:24.000 --> 01:28.000]  So that was pretty rough. But this happened a year ago.\n",
            "[01:28.000 --> 01:33.000]  So one of my close friends was like, I can't afford these prices. There's just no way.\n",

            "[01:39.000 --> 01:45.000]  And a lot of people suggested a lot of different solutions.\n",
            "[01:45.000 --> 01:51.000]  Most of them were like, were motivated from anger.\n",
            "[01:51.000 --> 01:55.000]  So some people were like, oh, yeah, everybody who moves out, she's not to pay.\n",
            "[01:55.000 --> 01:59.000]  And other people were like, oh, no, if I'm not living there, I shouldn't have to do anything.\n",
            "[01:59.000 --> 02:03.000]  So it's like pretty contentious.\n",
            "[02:03.000 --> 02:14.000]  But we worked it out to it was like a variation of a plan that I suggested, which was that we would we would change the rent based on room size.\n",
            "[02:14.000 --> 02:20.000]  And how many people were living in the room. So we'd allow people to have more space themselves and pay more.\n",
            "[02:20.000 --> 02:28.000]  But people who would have otherwise been forced out could could have more people crammed into a into a room and save a lot of money.\n",
            "[02:28.000 --> 02:32.000]  So we kept some people that we kicked out. Oh, God.\n",
            "[02:32.000 --> 02:39.000]  Yeah, but it was pretty rough to get that motion passed.\n",
            "[02:39.000 --> 02:45.000]  So you tell me what one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to improve on it.\n",
            "[02:45.000 --> 02:51.000]  I'm the opposite of Ty Day, so I can be pretty disorganized.\n",
            "[02:51.000 --> 02:54.000]  My lab notebooks, I have a lot of scribbles in it.\n",
            "[02:54.000 --> 03:00.000]  And when I write code, the documentation tends to be on the shaky side.\n",
            "[03:00.000 --> 03:05.000]  So so it makes it kind of hard for other people to follow when doing later on.\n",
            "[03:05.000 --> 03:14.000]  And I never really thought it was a problem until the most recent project I've been on that I had to leave the project for a short amount of time.\n",
            "[03:14.000 --> 03:17.000]  And my partner picked up where I left off and he had no idea what was going on.\n",
            "[03:17.000 --> 03:25.000]  And I was like, this is actually a problem. The teacher was like, don't just tell you to document, just aggregate you.\n",
            "[03:25.000 --> 03:45.000]  So I worked. So like since then, like I've been working on like documenting what I do just like more diligently, but then also to check back up on it so that like there's some kind of like review before like I show other people what I or before I let it out to a point that other people might rely on it.\n",
            "[03:45.000 --> 03:52.000]  So just to like read my documentation and which I've never done before until like this most recent project like that problem.\n",
            "[03:52.000 --> 03:55.000]  That's always a good practice. Yeah.\n",
            "[03:55.000 --> 04:00.000]  So now thinking about a job that you'd like to have. Do you have one in mind?\n",
            "[04:00.000 --> 04:01.000]  Sure. Okay.\n",
            "[04:01.000 --> 04:05.000]  So now why should we hire you?\n",
            "[04:05.000 --> 04:09.000]  Mostly because\n",
            "[04:09.000 --> 04:12.000]  results. I just like get things done.\n",
            "[04:12.000 --> 04:20.000]  And there's like there's a lot of things I know how to do, especially the job I'm thinking of is that is like a programming job at a startup.\n",
            "[04:20.000 --> 04:25.000]  Okay. And like my background, my degree is actually nuclear engineering.\n",
            "[04:25.000 --> 04:45.000]  So so like I don't have like the background, I don't have the internship and stuff like that. A lot of the coding interview questions that they ask like I tend to not know, which is pretty rough, but I think that I would be hired. I should be hired because I would be resourceful and I do what it takes to get things done, which is like working longer, being more resourceful and stuff like that.\n",
            "[04:45.000 --> 04:51.000]  So like I believe I can get like more results than somebody who has like the same or has a better background.\n",
            "[04:51.000 --> 04:55.000]  Excellent. Well, thanks for coming today.\n",
